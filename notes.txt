MEDIA QUERY
Every utility class in Tailwind can be applied conditionally at different breakpoints, which makes it a piece of cake to build complex responsive interfaces without ever leaving your HTML.
There are five breakpoints by default, inspired by common device resolutions:

Breakpoint prefix	Minimum width	CSS
sm	                    640px	    @media (min-width: 640px) { ... }
md	                    768px	    @media (min-width: 768px) { ... }
lg	                    1024px	    @media (min-width: 1024px) { ... }
xl	                    1280px	    @media (min-width: 1280px) { ... }
2xl	                    1536px	    @media (min-width: 1536px) { ... }

To add a utility but only have it take effect at a certain breakpoint, all you need to do is prefix the utility with the breakpoint name, followed by the : character:

<!-- Width of 16 by default, 32 on medium screens, and 48 on large screens -->
<img class="w-16 md:w-32 lg:w-48" src="...">

by default tailwind css follow min-width


PSEUDO class

Using utilities to style elements on hover, focus, and more.

Every utility class in Tailwind can be applied conditionally by adding a modifier to the beginning of the class name that describes the condition you want to target.

<button class="bg-sky-500 hover:bg-sky-700 ...">
  Save changes
</button>

Traditionally the same class name applies different styles on hover

.btn-primary {
  background-color: #0ea5e9;
}
.btn-primary:hover {
  background-color: #0369a1;
}

Tailwind includes modifiers for just about everything youâ€™ll ever need, including:

Pseudo-classes, like :hover, :focus, :first-child, and :required
Pseudo-elements, like ::before, ::after, ::placeholder, and ::selection

The active prefix in Tailwind CSS is applied, whenever an element is currently pressed.
        <button class="bg-green-600 p-4 rounded-md active:bg-green-700"> 
                    Hello Geek! 
        </button>
